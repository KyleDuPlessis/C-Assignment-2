Makefile rules:

Makefile in project folder (Assignment2_DPLKYL002):

[* - use these rules here]

make - compile this project folder only
*make all - compile the entire project
*make run args="***" - run the program
*make clean - clean the entire project

***volimage <imageBase>
***volimage <imageBase> [-d i j output_file_name]
***volimage <imageBase> [-x i output_file_name]
***volimage <imageBase> [-g i output_file_name]

Note: 
- You can do only ONE of the difference map, extract or row extract operations - NOT both or all three during the same invocation of
volimage.
- Don't include the angle and square brackets.

Run example for difference map:
make run args="volimage brain_mri_raws/MRI -d 11 14 output/output1"

Makefiles in /libs/volimagelib folders:
make - compile this folder only
make clean - clean this folder only

Explanation of what each file does and how it fits into the program as a whole:

Volimage.cpp & Volimage.h - These source and header files does the image manipulation (processing) - implementing all 
			the operation functionality such as: difference map, extract and row extract.
			
Driver.cpp - This driver source file contains the main function (entry point to the program). It parses the command line 
	 using the argc and argv values passed into main() and uses these arguments to invoke the correct operation function.
